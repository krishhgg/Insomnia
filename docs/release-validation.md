# Release validation

This record separates automated evidence from real-machine safety validation.
It is not a certification that unattended or lid-closed use is safe.

## September 14, 2026 baseline

The pre-fix audit found lifecycle races, incomplete recovery reporting,
uninstall recovery loss, Docker daemon-selection ambiguity, and tmux work
continuing after session end. The main-branch baseline passed 178 Swift tests;
the separate icon PR added one packaging test. Seven audit-only failure-path
tests reproduced bugs despite that green baseline. A historical secret scan
reported no detected secrets across 175 locally available commits.

## Remediation evidence

- [CI PR #2](https://github.com/kgarg2468/Insomnia/pull/2), commit
  `f20a860`: hosted macOS tests/release build, ShellCheck, and Greptile check
  succeeded. No unresolved review threads were present at verification.
- [Automation PR #3](https://github.com/kgarg2468/Insomnia/pull/3), commit
  `52a3b29`: after addressing three Greptile findings and a timeout-reporting
  defect, an independent snapshot passed 206 tests, release compilation, and
  ShellCheck. The three review threads are resolved. Follow-up `ba82712`
  installs tmux on the hosted runner: CI now executes the pane tests instead
  of skipping them. Hosted CI reports 206 tests with one animation-dependent
  UI test skipped, zero failures, and a successful release build and ShellCheck.
  The Greptile check also passed. These tests include
  private tmux-server tests and a fake Docker executable against a temporary
  Unix socket. Removing cancellation and endpoint guards caused regression
  tests to fail. Additional cases cover cancelling a queued command before
  launch, retaining the checked tmux pane across an active-pane change, and
  stopping during a suspended hotspot join. This is not a live Docker-freeze
  or hotspot validation.
- Recovery/lifecycle remediation before PR review: an independent snapshot of the source,
  test, and script tree passed 315 tests with zero failures, zero skips, and no
  compiler warnings. Release compilation and ShellCheck passed. A redacted
  source secret scan detected no findings. Tests exercise injected power/audio
  failures, lifecycle races, process identity, launchd sequencing, and temporary
  recovery/install/uninstall fixtures; they do not mutate live power settings or
  install/remove the working app. Hosted CI and automated review must also be
  checked on the resulting PR's latest head.
- PR #4 review reproduced two further failure paths: unconfirmed process
  ownership after a failed journal save, and installer loss of the previous
  recovery agent. Follow-up tests cover provisional non-resumable freeze
  entries, preserving the trusted plist on bootstrap failure, and holding the
  shared recovery lock throughout installer recovery and agent replacement.
  The hosted lock-test fixture now uses an explicit release signal instead of
  assuming its simulated command stays alive for a fixed number of seconds.
  Independent verification of the combined follow-up source/tests/scripts
  passed 329 tests with zero failures, zero skips, and no compiler warnings;
  release compilation and ShellCheck also passed. Hosted checks remain a
  separate gate on the PR's latest commit.

Check each PR's latest commit and check results; this record does not make an
earlier green run evidence for subsequent changes.

## September 16, 2026 lid-close audit

During an active session on the development MacBook the user closed the lid
and the panel stayed lit with the keyboard backlight on. The log shows the
session starting at 00:48:12, the lid closing at 00:48:19 and opening at
00:48:25, with Insomnia's lid-close transaction running and freezing Slack
(6 pids) only. `pmset -g log` has no "Display is turned off" event in that
window; the next display-off is the 2-minute idle timer at 01:08:51. Root
cause: `pmset -a disablesleep 1` (the sleep guard) removes the only path by
which macOS turns the built-in panel and keyboard backlight off on clamshell
close (the system-sleep path), and spec section 4 claimed both were "already
off by hardware", so `LidActions` never touched them. Primitives measured on
that machine, without root, and now used by `DisplayPower.swift`:
`DisplayServicesGetBrightness` / `SetBrightness` / `CanChangeBrightness`
(present, rc 0, immediate; `GetBrightness` can return a dimmed value during
the "delayDisplayOff" phase); display sleep via `IORequestIdle` on
`IODisplayWrangler` (honoured only without `PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep`
assertions and deferred ~30 s after a wake, so best effort); wake via
`IOPMAssertionDeclareUserActivity(kIOPMUserActiveLocal)` within ~1 s; and
`KeyboardBrightnessClient` (`copyKeyboardBacklightIDs`, `isKeyboardBuiltIn:`,
`brightnessForKeyboard:`, `setBrightness:forKeyboard:`; one built-in id).
Display brightness 0 does not switch the keyboard backlight off. The
computer-use agent declares `UserIsActive` and `PreventUserIdleDisplaySleep`
every ~40 s, so the design does not fight it: brightness 0 keeps the panel
dark either way. No sudoers or install change was needed. The fix is covered
by unit tests with fakes only; the rows below stay "Not run" until exercised
on hardware.

A simulated run of that fix on the same machine, later on September 16, 2026
(`scripts/simulate-lid.sh` during a session, lid open), found a defect in
what was saved. The close happened after the panel had idle-dimmed and slept:
`DisplayServicesGetBrightness` returned the idle-dim value (0.0625, user value
0.5), and with the display asleep the keyboard backlight was suppressed
(`isBacklightSuppressedOnKeyboard:` true), so `brightnessForKeyboard:`
returned 0; the journal held 0.0625 and 0, and the open restored a dim panel
and a dead backlight. Also measured: powerd keeps its own "pre-dim"
brightness and re-applies it asynchronously on every display wake, so a
restore written right after `IOPMAssertionDeclareUserActivity` can be
overridden a moment later; writes made while the display is asleep never
update that memory; the keyboard idle-dims on its own
(`isBacklightDimmedOnKeyboard:`); and
`CGEventSource.secondsSinceLastEventType(.hidSystemState, kCGAnyInputEventType)`
(public, no permission) gives the idle time, with the idle dim never starting
within 30 s of input. The fix: a reading is trusted only with idle under 30 s
and the device awake/unsuppressed, `BrightnessSampler` keeps the last trusted
reading (every 30 s with the lid open, at start, 3 s after each open), the
close journals the trusted value or the sample, leaves the keyboard alone when
neither exists, and the open re-asserts the restore 2 s after the wake. Unit
tests with fakes only; the hardware rows below are unchanged.

## Hardware validation still required

None of the cases below is certified by the automated regression suite. Record
the tested commit, hardware, macOS version, date, and actual evidence when each
is performed. Do not replace "not run" with "passed" based on source review.

| Scenario | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Normal end, deadline expiry, and repeated Quit restore live power state | Not run for release fixes |
| Force-quit followed by launchd deadline recovery and retry after failure | Not run |
| Reboot/login with active or dirty journals | Not run |
| Lid-close/open and safe recovery of explicitly selected test processes | Not run |
| Lid-close display/keyboard darkening and restore | Not run |
| Freeze-all scope with agents running (Cursor/T3 Code/Claude untouched) | Not run |
| Simulated lid close/open via scripts/simulate-lid.sh | Not run |
| Existing Low Power Mode preference and saved audio restoration | Not run |
| Docker Desktop idle/busy behavior with another Docker context selected | Not run |
| Hotspot permission, association, cancellation, and reconnect | Not run |
| Settings location note matches what System Settings shows after the grant | Not run |
| tmux cancellation with a dedicated disposable pane | Not run |
| Headed-browser throttling with the lid closed | Not run |
| Battery/thermal event behavior on supported hardware | Not run |
| Unreadable battery (IOKit miss) ends the session on a laptop after the second read; desktop unaffected | Not run |
| Install/upgrade/uninstall with recoverable failure conditions | Not run |
| Start shows the administrator password dialog (names Insomnia's purpose, not just osascript) and `pmset -g` shows `SleepDisabled 1` after it | Not run |
| Cancel in the dialog, a wrong password, and no answer for 120 s each roll the start back: no session, `SleepDisabled` absent, journal clean, "Session not started" notification; the dialog closes when the 120 s SIGTERM lands | Not run |
| Relaunch (and login) with a valid session and `SleepDisabled 1` keeps the session without a prompt | Not run |
| Relaunch with a valid session after `sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0` by hand ends the session with the "turned back on" notification, no prompt | Not run |
| Reinstall over an older four-line `/etc/sudoers.d/insomnia` leaves exactly the three passwordless lines | Not run |
| A dialog whose osascript has not exited 3 s after the 120 s SIGTERM is reported with its pid (notification and menu warning line), nothing is killed, and the start rolls back once it exits | Not run |
| An upgrade whose running app refuses to quit stops before the password prompt and leaves `/etc/sudoers.d/insomnia` byte for byte as it was | Not run |
| An upgrade stopped after the rule is written (open the app while the password prompt is up) leaves exactly the three passwordless lines, keeps the old bundle, and prints the rerun command; the rerun finishes the install | Not run |

Hardware tests must be supervised and must not endanger active user work. Use
a stable, ventilated surface, not an enclosure. Do not intentionally overheat a
machine to validate thermal handling; exercise injected thermal events first.

Launchd sequencing tests use a fake command runner. Actual bootstrap of the
private candidate plist, login loading, and crash recovery must still be
checked on the supported macOS release. Installer tests redirect every app,
LaunchAgent, sudoers, and command target into a temporary fixture. Real build,
signing, privileged installation, and quit refusal by a running app have not
been exercised as an end-to-end installation on a working Mac.

## Distribution boundary

Local source builds use ad-hoc signing. Developer ID signing, notarization,
download packaging, and a consumer installation/recovery walkthrough have not
been completed. Open-source availability and a passing PR are not equivalent
to readiness for a signed public binary release.
