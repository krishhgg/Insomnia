# Insomnia backstop: restore the machine from the JSON journal alone.
# Runs from launchd (RunAtLoad + StartInterval 60, installed by install.sh)
# and from install.sh / uninstall.sh. Needs no Insomnia process and no Swift.
#
# Where it lives: install.sh copies this file into the app bundle at
# Insomnia.app/Contents/Resources/backstop.sh before signing the bundle, so
# the signature's resource seal covers it. The LaunchAgent's command line
# runs `codesign --verify --strict` on the bundle against the requirement
# pinned in the plist (for an ad-hoc build, the cdhash of that build) and
# execs this file only when that passes; an edited copy makes the check fail
# and the agent logs one line and runs nothing. Nothing executable is kept in
# Application Support (installs before this layout ran a writable copy from
# there; install.sh removes it once the new agent is loaded).
#
# Every run is one transaction under APP_SUPPORT/.recovery.lock, an flock(2)
# exclusive lock on the same file the app locks: read session.json and
# state.json, decide, undo, publish the new journal atomically, release. If
# the lock is not free within LOCK_TIMEOUT_SECONDS the run does nothing and
# exits 75; launchd retries a minute later. The lock file is never unlinked
# or replaced here, so every party locks the same inode.
#
# Locking detail: the script opens the lock file on fd 9 and locks that fd
# with `lockf <fd>`. If a caller (uninstall.sh) already holds the lock and
# passes its handle down as fd 9, locking fd 9 again shares the caller's lock
# instead of deadlocking against it; fd 9 is accepted only if its inode is
# the lock file's inode.
#
# Decision, driven only by what the journal says was changed:
#   - session.json valid (endsAt in the future) and no --force: exit 0.
#   - state.json missing or clean: nothing is undone and nothing privileged
#     runs; an expired session.json is removed. Exit 0. Entries in
#     savedAudioOutputs alone count as clean (see below).
#   - state.json dirty: undo each journaled entry from the journal alone:
#       sleepDisabledByUs   -> sudo -n pmset -a disablesleep 0
#       lowPowerSetByUs     -> sudo -n pmset -b lowpowermode 0
#       frozenProcesses     -> SIGCONT, but only to a pid verified to be the
#                              process the app froze. Entries that record
#                              startedAtMicros are handed to the installed
#                              app binary (INSOMNIA_BIN --resume-frozen
#                              <seconds>) in one call with a time limit, one
#                              line per entry on its standard input. For
#                              each entry in turn it does one kernel lookup
#                              (start time to the microsecond, boot session,
#                              stopped state) immediately followed by that
#                              entry's SIGCONT; this script never signals
#                              such an entry itself. The binary runs only
#                              when the bundle's Info.plist declares the
#                              interface version this script speaks
#                              (InsomniaResumeFrozenVersion), and it keeps
#                              the lock on fd 9 until it exits, which it does
#                              by itself after <seconds>. When the binary is
#                              missing, does not declare that version, cannot
#                              run, times out, or answers anything but one
#                              documented line per entry, those entries are
#                              kept and not signaled. An entry
#                              without startedAtMicros (an older build) is
#                              checked here instead: it must exist, be
#                              stopped, have started in this boot session at
#                              the journaled second (ps -o lstart) and belong
#                              to this user. A pid observed gone, running, or
#                              not matching is cleared without a signal. A pid
#                              that cannot be observed (ps fails or prints
#                              something unparseable) is kept. In both paths
#                              an entry from another boot session is cleared
#                              without a lookup.
#       frozenPids (legacy)  -> never signaled and never cleared here, even if
#                              the pid is gone: nothing proves the stopped
#                              process is ours. Only the app resolves them.
#       savedOutputVolume / savedMuted -> CoreAudio; only the app can restore
#                              these. Kept for the app's reconcile.

#                              device a lid close muted, by device UID; only
#                              the app can restore these, and only while the
#                              device is connected. Kept for the app, and on
#                              their own they leave the journal clean: an
#                              entry can wait days for its device, the app's
#                              menu shows it, and an error every minute here
#                              would only fill the log. They are logged once
#                              when this run removes a session or undoes
#                              something else.

#                              not dirty, since no run here or of that app
#                              build can restore it.
#       appNapOverrides     -> NSAppSleepDisabled the app set to YES in an
#                              agent app's preferences, with the value it had
#                              before: defaults write <bundleId>
#                              NSAppSleepDisabled -bool <previous>, or
#                              defaults delete <bundleId> NSAppSleepDisabled
#                              when the key was absent. A delete that fails
#                              counts as done only when defaults read then
#                              says the key does not exist; a read that
#                              fails any other way proves nothing and the
#                              entry stays.
#     A flag is cleared only after its undo succeeded. Unknown keys survive.
#     Exit 0 only when the journal is clean afterwards; otherwise exit 1 so
#     the failure is visible and the next periodic run retries.
#   - state.json unreadable, not a JSON object, or with a known key of the
#     wrong type: nothing is touched, exit 1.
#   - session.json present but not a session: readable, but not the shape
#     the app's Session decoder accepts (session_shape_problems). It is
#     treated as expired. Once the journal is clean (already, or after the
#     undo above succeeded) the file is renamed to
#     session.json.unreadable-<UTC stamp>, never deleted or overwritten, so
#     the next run sees no session. While the journal stays dirty it stays.
#   - session.json present but not readable at all (permissions, I/O), or
#     not a regular file (a FIFO or device is never opened: open(2) could
#     block while this run holds the lock): its end time is unknown, and
#     sleep is never held without a deadline that can be enforced, so it is
#     treated as expired and the journal is undone as above. The file is
#     never opened, read or removed: it may have been a valid session. Once
#     the journal is clean it is renamed aside like a malformed one, so its
#     bytes stay as evidence and no later run, of this script or the app,
#     can read it back as a session that was already treated as ended. A
#     state.json that is not a regular file is malformed.
#
# Limitation: for an entry without startedAtMicros the shell compares process
# start time to the second only. For every entry a lookup and a signal are
# still two operations, in the app binary as here; the binary does each
# entry's lookup right before that entry's signal, never all lookups first.
#
# --force: treat the session as expired even if endsAt is in the future
# (used by install.sh / uninstall.sh to end a stale session deliberately).

# exit status; 124 when it did not finish within COMMAND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS and
# ended within KILL_GRACE_SECONDS of the SIGTERM it then got; 125, with
# command_alive=1, when it was still running after that, or when no status
# came in time.
# A command still running after SIGTERM is never SIGKILLed: killing sudo
# would orphan a root pmset that could change power state later, outside any
# transaction. Its supervisor keeps waiting and so keeps the lock, and the
# pid is logged for manual intervention. The caller must then end the
# transaction (stop_transaction): no later undo command may run beside a live
# one, and the journal stays as it was. Every later app start and backstop
# run is refused as "lock held" until that command ends. A missing status
# ends the transaction the same way: nothing here can tell whether the
# command still runs, and stopping is the safe side.
# Each call gets its own status files (.backstop.<this run's pid>.<call>.pid
# and .rc), so a status can never be read as another command's. The .pid file
# is for the log only. Nothing signals the pid read from it: by the time it
# is read the supervisor may have reaped the command, and the number may
# belong to another process. A call that ended removes its files; a call that
# returned 125 leaves them to its live supervisor. The first call of a run
# that took the lock on its own handle removes what earlier runs left: their
# supervisors kept the lock while they lived, so all of them have ended. A
# run that shares its caller's lock (fd 9) skips that: an earlier run under
# the same lock may still have a supervisor waiting for its command.

# the supervisor does, until sudo reports that the command finished. Both
# limits are measured here (see wait_for_job), so they hold even if this run
# is killed while it waits.
# The supervisor ignores SIGTERM and SIGHUP, so neither the end of this run,
# killed or not, nor either signal sent to its whole process group frees the
# lock while the command runs. launchd signals what is left of a job's
# process group once the job's main process has exited, unless the job sets
# AbandonProcessGroup, which this agent does not. SIGINT and SIGQUIT are
# ignored already, as in every background job of a script. SIGKILL cannot be
# ignored: a supervisor killed with it frees the lock even if its command is
# still running. The command gets back the SIGTERM and SIGHUP actions this
# script started with (the defaults, under launchd), so it still stops on
# SIGTERM.
# The command is the supervisor's only job, so it stays in the supervisor's
# job list until the supervisor has reaped it, and signal_job (see

# signal therefore names the job (%+) once signal_job has checked that %+ is
# this pid: bash's kill looks the job up with SIGCHLD blocked and signals it
# only if bash has not reaped it yet, and a child that has not been reaped
# keeps its pid, as a zombie at worst. The exit status is read with wait only
# after the job has left bash's running list. Unlike a power command this is
# our own unprivileged binary, so when SIGTERM does not end it within
# KILL_GRACE_SECONDS it gets SIGKILL: from then on it runs no more of its own
# code and so cannot send another signal.
# The binary inherits fd 9, so the recovery lock stays held for as long as it
