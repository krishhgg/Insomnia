# backstop with --force under that same lock, verifies for itself that the
# journal is clean, and only then removes the LaunchAgent, the sudoers rule,
# the app bundle, and the journal. Keeps config.json and the logs unless
# --purge. Everything after the quit happens while this process holds
# APP_SUPPORT/.recovery.lock, so neither a queued periodic backstop nor a
# relaunched app can republish the journal while it is being removed.
#
# If anything Insomnia changed is still journaled, nothing is removed: the
# LaunchAgent keeps retrying every minute, the sudoers rule keeps pmset
# undoable, and state.json keeps the evidence. The message says what to do.
#
# Deletion is by exact owned file, never by directory tree: --purge removes
# the files Insomnia writes (see Paths.swift), the session.json copies the
# app or backstop.sh moved aside (session.json.unreadable-<stamp>, only that
# exact shape), and then rmdir's its own directories only if they are empty.
# Only regular files are removed; anything else at one of those paths is
# left with a message. The lock file is never unlinked, so --purge leaves
# APP_SUPPORT/.recovery.lock (and therefore APP_SUPPORT).

Nothing was removed on purpose: the LaunchAgent keeps retrying every minute,
the sudoers rule keeps pmset undoable, and the journal keeps the evidence.

What to do, then rerun this script:
  - Saved audio (volume/mute), display brightness or keyboard backlight:
    open Insomnia.app; it restores them from the journal at launch. If the
    display is dark, press the brightness-up key first.
  - pmset failures (sleep / Low Power Mode): check $SUDOERS
    (rerun scripts/install.sh to reinstall it), or run
    'sudo pmset -a disablesleep 0' / 'sudo pmset -b lowpowermode 0' yourself.
  - Frozen or legacy pids: open Insomnia.app to resolve them, or inspect each
    with 'ps -o pid,stat,lstart,command -p <pid>' and 'kill -CONT <pid>' it
    yourself if it is a process you recognise.
  - App Nap (NSAppSleepDisabled): the recovery agent retries 'defaults write'
    or 'defaults delete' every minute, and Insomnia.app restores them at
    launch. If 'defaults' keeps failing, see the log.
  - Unreadable state.json: neither the app nor the recovery agent repairs or
    removes it. Repair it by hand from the log, or move it away yourself once
    you know its changes are undone.
  - session.json that does not parse: the recovery agent renames it to
    session.json.unreadable-<time> as soon as the journal is clean, and the
    app does the same at launch. It needs no action of its own.
  - session.json that cannot be read at all: its end time is unknown, so
    the app and the agent treat it as expired, undo the journal, and then
    rename it to session.json.unreadable-<time> without opening it. If it
