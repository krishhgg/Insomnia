# Security

Insomnia is experimental source-built software. There is no security-response
SLA or supported binary release series yet. Report suspected vulnerabilities
against the current main branch, including the affected revision and a minimal,
non-destructive reproduction.

Do not publish passwords, Keychain data, personal logs, or weaponized exploit
details in a public issue. If GitHub shows a **Report a vulnerability** action
on this repository's Security page, use that private channel. Otherwise open a
public issue containing only a request for a private security contact, without
the sensitive details, and wait for the maintainer to arrange one.

The installer grants the user account passwordless access to four exact pmset
commands listed in the README. This grant is not exclusive to the Insomnia app:
other processes running as that user can invoke them too. The app is not
sandboxed; local logs can contain SSIDs, process metadata, and tmux target names.
The lines the app writes to `insomnia.log` also reach the unified log with the
body marked private, so programs reading `log show` see `<private>` instead of
those names unless private data logging is enabled on the Mac. Location
Services access is requested only when a hotspot is saved or a session starts
with one configured; it is used to read Wi-Fi network names and the app never
requests location updates. With the App Nap setting on (off by default), the
app writes `NSAppSleepDisabled` into the preferences of each app on the agent
list, after recording the previous value in its journal, and puts it back at
session end.

The hotspot password is a generic-password item in the login Keychain
(service `insomnia-hotspot`). Its access list names only the Insomnia build
that saved it, so any other program asking for it gets the system Keychain
prompt, which you can refuse. Insomnia itself reads the item with prompts
switched off: an item it may not read is reported in the menu and in Settings
instead of being prompted for or silently ignored. Two limits remain. Ad-hoc
signing gives every install a new code identity, so the access list pins one
build and the password must be entered again after a reinstall; a stable
signing identity (Developer ID) would let the access list name every build
signed with it. And the item lives in the file-based login Keychain, which
ignores the data-protection accessibility classes (this device only, when
unlocked); using that Keychain needs an access-group entitlement, which needs
a team id. Both wait on a signed release.

Passing automated checks or a secret scan does not establish the absence of
vulnerabilities. Do not probe recovery by disrupting someone else's processes,
power settings, network, or data.
