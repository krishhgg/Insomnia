/// Everything Insomnia writes under its own two directories is owner-only.

/// Files are created 0600 and the directories Insomnia owns 0700. A file or
/// directory that already exists with a looser mode (an older build, a
/// copied tree, a wide umask) is tightened when it is next opened.
/// Tightening only clears bits: it never adds one, so a file its owner made
/// unreadable stays that way. A symlink is left alone, together with
/// whatever it points at. So is an access control list: an entry can be
/// what lets the owner read a 0200 journal, and a journal recovery cannot
/// read leaves sleep disabled. A chmod that fails is reported, not
/// dropped: once per path through `reportOnce` for
/// the journal, config and lock, and as an error thrown after the line is
/// written for the two logs. backstop.sh does the same for what it creates
/// with `umask 077`, and tightens what an older build left loose.
///
/// The two logs are also capped: past `maxLogBytes` the file is renamed to
/// `<name>.1`, replacing the previous `.1`, and the next line starts a new
/// file. The rename runs under flock(2) on the file, with a check that the
/// file held is still the one at the path, so two processes that both find
/// the log oversized cannot rotate it twice and rename the fresh log over
/// the retained copy. A log that is a symlink is never rotated, since the
/// rename would move the link itself; that is reported once, and the cap
/// does not hold for it. The user set up the link, so the file it points to
/// is theirs to trim. The backstop appends with `>>` and never rotates, so
/// it simply creates the fresh file.
