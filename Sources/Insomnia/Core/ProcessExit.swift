/// Waits for a child `Process` to exit. Use it instead of
/// `Process.waitUntilExit()`, which can wait forever for a child that has
/// already exited and been reaped.
///
/// On macOS 26, `waitUntilExit()` polls the calling thread's run loop every
/// 62.5 ms. If the task has no `terminationHandler` and the calling thread
/// looks like the one that launched it, the poll also waits for the
/// termination notification, which Foundation queues on the launching
/// thread's run loop. Foundation decides "launched here" by looking for the
/// task's address in a per-thread list that every launch appends to and
/// nothing prunes. A new `Process` at the address of one this thread launched
/// earlier, launched by another thread, matches. If the launching thread
/// never runs its run loop (a GCD or Swift concurrency worker), the
/// notification never goes out and the wait never returns.
///
/// This waits for `terminationHandler`, which Foundation calls on a dispatch
/// queue after it has reaped the child, whichever thread launched it. Create
/// it before `run()`: it replaces the process's `terminationHandler`. Wait
/// only after `run()` succeeded; a child that never started never exits.
