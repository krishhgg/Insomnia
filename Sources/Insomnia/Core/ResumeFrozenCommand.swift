/// `Insomnia --resume-frozen <seconds>`, journal entries on standard input
///
/// One-shot mode for backstop.sh. The shell can read a process's start time
/// only to the second (`ps -o lstart`), so for the journal entries that
/// record microseconds it asks this binary to do what the app does on lid
/// open, through the same `SignalProcessControl.resume`: for each entry in
/// turn, one kernel lookup (start time to the microsecond, boot session,
/// stopped state) immediately followed by that entry's SIGCONT, before the
/// next entry is looked up. One launch covers every entry. Nothing else
/// runs: no AppKit, no journal, no lock of its own (the caller holds the
/// recovery lock and rewrites the journal from the answer).
///
/// `<seconds>` is how long this process may live, a whole number from 1 to
/// 300. Before it reads anything it arranges to end itself with SIGALRM
/// that many seconds later, whatever SIGALRM disposition and mask it
/// inherited. backstop.sh passes its own time limit and runs this mode with
/// the recovery lock open on fd 9, so the lock stays held for as long as
/// this process can send a signal, even when the shell that started it dies
/// first; the time limit then frees the lock without anyone waiting for it.
///
/// Standard input holds one entry per line, `<pid> <startedAt>
/// <startedAtMicros> <bootSession>`: four fields, one space between them,
/// every line ending in a newline. Standard input has no size limit, unlike
/// the argument list (ARG_MAX), so a journal of any length fits in one
/// call. Prints one line per entry, in input order, `<pid> <word>`:
///
///     resumed       identity matched, the process was stopped, SIGCONT delivered
///     gone          no such pid, running, or a different process: nothing to do
///     failed        identity matched, SIGCONT failed; try again later
///     unobserved    the kernel would not say what the pid is; try again later
///     unverifiable  the fallthrough for an answer with no boot session to compare; never signaled
///
/// Exits 0 when every entry is `resumed` or `gone`, 1 when any is not. A
/// missing or malformed `<seconds>`, any further argument, empty input, or
/// a malformed line prints the single line `usage` (details on stderr),
/// checks nothing, and exits 64. The shell clears an entry on `resumed` and
/// `gone` and keeps it otherwise, and keeps every entry when the answer is
/// not exactly this shape.
///
/// The app bundle declares this interface as `InsomniaResumeFrozenVersion`
/// (`version`) in its Info.plist. backstop.sh runs the binary only when the
/// installed bundle declares the version the script speaks, so it never
/// starts an older build, which would open the menu bar app instead.
