/// Spec section 7: after a long outage, type `continue` into every listed
/// tmux pane that the user has marked for nudges, and press Enter only when
/// `Config.tmuxNudgePressesEnter` is on. Failures are logged, never thrown.
///
/// A pane is marked with a pane-scoped tmux user option:
///
///     tmux set-option -p -t <target> @insomnia-nudge on
///
/// The mark is read fresh before every send with `show-options -p` on the
/// concrete pane and without `-A`, so an option set on the session or the
/// window never counts: only a pane the user marked on purpose is touched.
/// An unmarked pane is skipped and logged.
///
/// Automation boundary: a keystroke that has reached tmux cannot be taken
/// back. So the loop re-checks, before *every* target, that its task is not
/// cancelled and that the session which asked for the nudge still exists,
/// and the live runner checks cancellation again before each command. The
/// live runner also refuses a pane whose state it cannot verify or where
/// keys would not reach the program (dead, in copy/choose mode, input off).
/// Residual risk, not closable from outside tmux: the flags above cannot
/// show text the pane's program has buffered but not yet submitted. If a
/// half-typed line is pending, `continue` is appended to it, and with Enter
/// enabled the whole line is submitted. That is why Enter is off by default
/// and why the mark should go on a dedicated pane.
